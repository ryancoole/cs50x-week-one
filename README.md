# CS50x - Week 1: C

This repo contains my solutions for **Week 1** of Harvard's [CS50x](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course. The focus this week was on learning the basics of the **C programming language**, including:

- Data Types
- Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Command Line
- Magic Numbers

## ✅ Projects

### `hello world`

In a file called `hello.c`, in a folder called `me`, implement a program in C that prompts the user for their name and then says hello to that user. For instance, if the user’s name is Adele, your program should print `hello, Adele\n`!

### `mario pyramids`

In a file called `mario.c` in a folder called `mario-more`, implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:
<pre>
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
</pre>
And let’s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive int between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.

### `credit card validation`

In a file called `credit.c` in a folder called `credit`, implement a program in C that checks the validity of a given credit card number.
